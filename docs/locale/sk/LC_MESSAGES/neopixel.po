msgid "From our tests, the Microbit Neopixel module can drive up to around 256 Neopixels. Anything above that and you may experience weird bugs and issues."

msgid "NeoPixels are fun strips of multi-coloured programmable LEDs. This module contains everything to plug them into a micro:bit and create funky displays, art and games such as the demo shown below."

#: ../../neopixel.rst:25
msgid "To connect a strip of neopixels you'll need to attach the micro:bit as shown below (assuming you want to drive the pixels from pin 0 - you can connect neopixels to pins 1 and 2 too). The label on the crocodile clip tells you where to attach the other end on the neopixel strip."

msgid "Initialise a new strip of ``n`` number of neopixel LEDs controlled via pin ``pin``. Each pixel is addressed by a position (starting from 0). Neopixels are given RGB (red, green, blue) values between 0-255 as a tuple. For example, ``(255,255,255)`` is white."
