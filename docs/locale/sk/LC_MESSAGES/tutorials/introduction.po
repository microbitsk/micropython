"Python is one of the `world's most popular "

"programming languages. Every day, without realising, you probably use "
"software written using Python. All sorts of companies and organisations "
"use Python for a diverse range of applications. Google, NASA, Bank of "
"America, Disney, CERN, YouTube, Mozilla, The Guardian - the list goes on "

"One such area is the BBC's amazing micro:bit device. It runs a version of"
" Python called MicroPython that's designed to run on small computers like"
" the BBC micro:bit. It's a full implementation of Python 3 so when you "
"move onto other things (such as programming Python on a Raspberry Pi) "
"you'll use exactly the same language."

"MicroPython does not include all the standard code libraries that come "
"with \"regular\" Python. However, we have created a special ``microbit`` "
"module in MicroPython that lets you control the device."

"Python and MicroPython are free software. Not only does this mean you "
"don't pay anything to use Python, but you are also free to contribute "
"back to the Python community. This may be in the form of code, "
"documentation, bug reports, running a community group or writing "
"tutorials (like this one). In fact, all the Python related resources for "
"the BBC micro:bit have been created by an international team of "
"volunteers working in their free time."
