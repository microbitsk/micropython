"There are strips of metal along the bottom edge of the BBC micro:bit that"
" make it look as if the device has teeth. These are the input/output pins"
" (or I/O pins for short)."

"Some of the pins are bigger than others so it's possible to attach "
"crocodile clips to them. These are the ones labelled 0, 1, 2, 3V and GND "
"(computers always start counting from zero). If you attach an edge "
"connector board to the device it's possible to plug in wires connected to"
" the other (smaller) pins."

"Each pin on the BBC micro:bit is represented by an *object* called "
"``pinN`` where ``N`` is the pin number. So, for example, to do things "
"with the pin labelled with a 0 (zero), use the object called ``pin0``."

"The simplest example of input via the pins is a check to see if they are "

"The device is put into an infinite loop and immediately switches pin 0 "
"on. This causes the buzzer to emit a beep. While the buzzer is beeping, "
"the device sleeps for twenty milliseconds and then switches pin 0 off. "
"This gives the effect of a short bleep. Finally, the device sleeps for "
"480 milliseconds before looping back and starting all over again. This "
"means you'll get two bleeps per second (one every 500 milliseconds)."
