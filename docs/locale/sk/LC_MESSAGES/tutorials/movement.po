"Your BBC micro:bit comes with an accelerometer. It measures movement "
"along three axes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:7
msgid "X - tilting from left to right."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:8
msgid "Y - tilting forwards and backwards."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:9
msgid "Z - moving up and down."

msgid ""
"There is a method for each axis that returns a positive or negative "
"number indicating a measurement in milli-g's. When the reading is 0 you "
"are \"level\" along that particular axis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:15
msgid ""
"For example, here's a very simple spirit-level that uses ``get_x`` to "
"measure how level the device is along the X axis::"

"If you hold the device flat it should display ``-``; however, rotate it "
"left or right and it'll show ``L`` and ``R`` respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:32
msgid ""
"We want the device to constantly react to change, so we use an infinite "
"``while`` loop. The first thing to happen *within the body of the loop* "
"is a measurement along the X axis which is called ``reading``. Because "
"the accelerometer is *so* sensitive I've made level +/-20 in range. It's "
"why the ``if`` and ``elif`` conditionals check for ``> 20`` and ``< "
"-20``. The ``else`` statement means that if the ``reading`` is between "
"-20 and 20 then we consider it level. For each of these conditions we use"
" the display to show the appropriate character."

"There is also a ``get_y`` method for the Y axis and a ``get_z`` method "
"for the Z axis."

"If you've ever wondered how a mobile phone knows which up to show the "
"images on its screen, it's because it uses an accelerometer in exactly "
"the same way as the program above. Game controllers also contain "
"accelerometers to help you steer and move around in games."

msgid ""
"One of the most wonderful aspects of MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit is "
"how it lets you easily link different capabilities of the device "
"together. For example, let's turn it into a musical instrument (of "
"sorts)."

"Connect a speaker as you did in the music tutorial. Use crocodile clips "
"to attach pin 0 and GND to the positive and negative inputs on the "
"speaker - it doesn't matter which way round they are connected to the "
"speaker."

"What happens if we take the readings from the accelerometer and play them"
" as pitches? Let's find out::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:71
msgid ""
"The key line is at the end and remarkably simple. We *nest* the reading "
"from the Y axis as the frequency to feed into the ``music.pitch`` method."
" We only let it play for 10 milliseconds because we want the tone to "
"change quickly as the device is tipped. Because the device is in an "
"infinite ``while`` loop it is constantly reacting to changes in the Y "
"axis measurement."

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:77
msgid "That's it!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/movement.rst:79
msgid ""
"Tip the device forwards and backwards. If the reading along the Y axis is"
" positive it'll change the pitch of the tone played by the micro:bit."

"Imagine a whole symphony orchestra of these devices. Can you play a tune?"
" How would you improve the program to make the micro:bit sound more "
"musical?"
