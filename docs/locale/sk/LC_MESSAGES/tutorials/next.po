"You will encounter frustration, failure and foolishness. When you do "
"please remember that you're not alone. Python has a secret weapon: the "
"most amazing community of programmers on the planet. Connect with this "

"The examples in the tutorials are simple to explain but may not be the "
"simplest or most efficient implementations. We've left out lots of "
"*really fun stuff* so we could concentrate on arming you with the basics."

"Explore, experiment and be fearless trying things out ~ for these are the"

"and Mu). They're fun rewards for looking \"under the hood\" and \"poking "
"with a stick\"."
