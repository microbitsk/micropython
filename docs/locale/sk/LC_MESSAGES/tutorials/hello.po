"...tells MicroPython to get all the stuff it needs to work with the BBC "
"micro:bit. All this stuff is in a module called ``microbit`` (a module is"
" a library of pre-existing code). When you ``import`` something you're "
"telling MicroPython that you want to use it, and ``*`` is Python's way to"
" say *everything*. So, ``from microbit import *`` means, in English, \"I "
"want to be able to use everything from the microbit code library\"."

"...tells MicroPython to use the display to scroll the string of "
"characters \"Hello, World!\". The ``display`` part of that line is an "
"*object* from the ``microbit`` module that represents the device's "
"physical display (we say \"object\" instead of \"thingy\", \"whatsit\" or"
" \"doodah\"). We can tell the display to do things with a full-stop ``.``"
" followed by what looks like a command (in fact it's something we call a "
"*method*). In this case we're using the ``scroll`` method. Since "
"``scroll`` needs to know what characters to scroll across the physical "
"display we specify them between double quotes (``\"``) within parenthesis"
" (``(`` and ``)``). These are called the *arguments*. So, "
"``display.scroll(\"Hello, World!\")`` means, in English, \"I want you to "
"use the display to scroll the text 'Hello, World!'\". If a method doesn't"
" need any arguments we make this clear by using empty parenthesis like "
"this: ``()``."

"Copy the \"Hello, World!\" code into your editor and flash it onto the "

"This is where things get fun and MicroPython tries to be helpful. If it "
"encounters an error it will scroll a helpful message on the micro:bit's "
"display. If it can, it will tell you the line number for where the error "

"Python expects you to type **EXACTLY** the right thing. So, for instance,"
" ``Microbit``, ``microbit`` and ``microBit`` are all different things to "
"Python. If MicroPython complains about a ``NameError`` it's probably "
"because you've typed something inaccurately. It's like the difference "
"between referring to \"Nicholas\" and \"Nicolas\". They're two different "
"people but their names look very similar."

"If MicroPython complains about a ``SyntaxError`` you've simply typed code"
" in a way that MicroPython can't understand. Check you're not missing any"
" special characters like ``\"`` or ``:``. It's like putting. a full stop "
"in the middle of a sentence. It's hard to understand exactly what you "
"mean."

"Your microbit may stop responding: you cannot flash new code to it or "
"enter commands into the REPL. If this happens, try power cycling it. That"
" is, unplug the USB cable (and battery cable if it's connected), then "
"plug the cable back in again. You may also need to quit and re-start your"
" code editor application."
