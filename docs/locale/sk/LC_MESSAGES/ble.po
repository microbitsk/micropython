#: ../../ble.rst:4
msgid "While the BBC micro:bit has hardware capable of allowing the device to work as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device, it only has 16k of RAM. The BLE stack alone takes up 12k RAM which means there's not enough room to run MicroPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ble.rst:8
msgid "Future versions of the device may come with 32k RAM which would be sufficient. However, until such time it's highly unlikely MicroPython will support BLE."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ble.rst:12
msgid "MicroPython uses the radio hardware with the ``radio`` module. This allows users to create simple yet effective wireless networks of micro:bit devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ble.rst:16
msgid "Furthermore, the protocol used in the ``radio`` module is a lot simpler than BLE, making it far easier to use in an educational context."
