"While the BBC micro:bit has hardware capable of allowing the device to "
"work as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device, it only has 16k of RAM. The "
"BLE stack alone takes up 12k RAM which means there's not enough room to "
"run MicroPython."

"Future versions of the device may come with 32k RAM which would be "
"sufficient. However, until such time it's highly unlikely MicroPython "
"will support BLE."

"MicroPython uses the radio hardware with the ``radio`` module. This "
"allows users to create simple yet effective wireless networks of "
"micro:bit devices."

"Furthermore, the protocol used in the ``radio`` module is a lot simpler "
"than BLE, making it far easier to use in an educational context."
